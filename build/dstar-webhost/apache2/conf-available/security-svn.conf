#
# Forbid access to version control directories
#
# If you use version control systems in your document root, you should
# probably deny access to their directories. For example, for subversion:
#
##-- moo: don't server .svn
<DirectoryMatch "/\.svn">
   Require all denied
</DirectoryMatch>
##-- /moo
